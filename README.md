# 🌧️ NOAA Atlas 14 Grids Miner

An automated tool for downloading, processing, and mosaicking NOAA Atlas 14 precipitation grids for hydrological analysis and flood modeling projects.

## 📋 Overview

This application automates the complex process of obtaining precipitation frequency data from NOAA Atlas 14, which is essential for hydrological modeling, flood risk assessment, and infrastructure design. The tool intelligently identifies relevant NOAA zones based on your project area and seamlessly combines data across zone boundaries.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🚀 **Automated Grid Retrieval**: Downloads precipitation grids directly from NOAA servers  
- 🗺️ **Smart Zone Detection**: Automatically identifies intersecting NOAA Atlas 14 zones for your project area  
- 🧩 **Grid Mosaicking**: Seamlessly combines grids across zone boundaries using maximum value method  
- 📊 **Confidence Intervals**: Generates 100-year + & - confidence interval grids for 100-year events  
- 🖥️ **Dual Interface**: Both web-based GUI and command-line interfaces available  
- 📁 **Organized Output**: Well-structured output folders with clear naming conventions  

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+  
- [Pixi package manager (recommended)](https://pixi.sh/latest/)  

### Using Pixi (Recommended)

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd NOAA-Atlas-14-Grids-Miner
pixi install
pixi shell
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Web Interface (Recommended)

```bash
python run_noaa_app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8502`

#### Configure settings:

- Set base directory for outputs  
- Upload project area shapefile (or use built-in sample)  
- Select recurrence intervals (1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 years)  
- Choose durations (5m to 24h)  
- Enable/disable confidence intervals  

Click **"Process NOAA Grids"** and monitor progress

### File Naming Convention
#### Downloaded Rasters
- `XXyrYYa.asc`: Precipitation depth (XX = return period, YY = duration)  
- `XXyrYYa_plus.asc`: Upper 84th percentile confidence interval  
- `XXyrYYa_minus.asc`: Lower 16th percentile confidence interval  
#### Mosaiced Rasters
- `combXXyrYYa.asc`: Precipitation depth (XX = return period, YY = duration)  
- `combXXyrYYa_plus.asc`: Upper 84th percentile confidence interval  
- `combXXyrYYa_minus.asc`: Lower 16th percentile confidence interval

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Encoding Error on Windows**  
- App will automatically fall back to subprocess method  
- App should still launch on `http://localhost:8502`  

**Missing Shapefile Components**  
- Ensure all required files (`.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf`, `.prj`) are uploaded  

**Download Failures**  
- Automatic retry is built-in  
- Check internet connection and NOAA server status  

**Memory Issues**  
- Process smaller areas or fewer parameters  
- Monitor system memory during processing  

### Getting Help

- Check processing log for detailed error info  
- Ensure dependencies are installed  
- Verify shapefile integrity and CRS
